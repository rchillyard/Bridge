  * This trait defines the behavior of a node (i.e. sub-tree) of a tree.
  * The node and therefore its tree are immutable!
  *
  * However, this trait does have some additional behavior.
  * In particular, it has a method for expanding a node of the tree, and doing it recursively.
  * Furthermore, this expansion has a short circuit such that, once a particular condition has been achieved,
  * tree construction comes to a halt and only the tree built thus far is returned.
  *
  * It's also possible to remove a node from the tree or to replace it with another node.
